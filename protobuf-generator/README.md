In Protocol Buffers (protobuf), a "message" is a fundamental concept and a building block used to define the structure of data. It's a way to encapsulate a collection of named fields, where each field has a unique identifier and a specific data type.


Field IDs are used to uniquely identify each field within a message. These IDs are important for serialization and deserialization when working with Protocol Buffers, as they help in encoding and decoding the data efficiently.


In Protocol Buffers (protobuf), a "service" is a higher-level construct used to define remote procedures that can be called by remote clients.
